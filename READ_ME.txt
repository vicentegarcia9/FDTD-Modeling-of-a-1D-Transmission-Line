This program will run the propagation of a trapezoidal pulse on a 1D transmission line with different input parameters.

These parameters are assigned as case studies.

When running the main script, it will be prompted to choose a case study from 0-7.

The script will take the case study chosen and will define the variables that link to that specific case study #
%1    Lossless with matched Rl, Rs
%2    Lossless with open circuit
%0    Lossless with short circuit
%3    Lossless with missmatched Rl and Rs
%4    Lossless with clfn=0.99 and missmatched Rl, Rs
%5    Lossy with missmatched Rl and Rs
%6    Lossless with missmatched Rs, and parallel RC load
%7    Lossless with missmatched Rs, and series RL load 

Lastly, after a case study is analyzed, just re-run the main script code for choosing another case under the same approach mentioned.
